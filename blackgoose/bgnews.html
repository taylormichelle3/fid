<h3>Low and Slow</h3>
<p><I>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</I></p>
<p>This week I am <I>extremely</I> excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <I>Cooking for Geeks</I>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><I>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b></I>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.<p>

<p>Location:
Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>

<p>Hours:
Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</p>
