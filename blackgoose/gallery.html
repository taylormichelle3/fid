<h1>Blackstone Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not only is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our bread" width="200" height="200"></a>
<br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>


<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="burgers-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our burgers" width="200" height="200"></a>
<br>
People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="fish-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our fish" width="200" height="200"></a>
<br>
Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Crispy Fried Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="chicken-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our fried chicken" width="200" height="200"></a>
<br>
Our famous crispy fried chicken is made to order using our secret batter recipe and sprinkled with a seasoning of your choice. Try it with our fries!</p>

<h2>Our Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="fries-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our fries" width="200" height="200"></a>
<br>
Each of our fries are made from local potatoes and fried to order. Order them as a side with any of our other dishes, or eat them as a snack!</p>

<h2>Our Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="close-up of our tabouleh" width="200" height="200"></a>
